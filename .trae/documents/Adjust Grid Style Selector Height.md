# Update Grid Style Selector Appearance

I will adjust the height of the grid style selection buttons in the settings modal to make them appear more square-shaped, as requested.

## Changes
- **File**: `modules/auth/ProfileModal.tsx`
- **Action**: Increase the height of the preview area within the grid type buttons.
- **Detail**: Change the height class from `h-6` (24px) to `h-10` (40px). This will make the overall button dimensions closer to a square aspect ratio.
